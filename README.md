# Blocjerk Token Contract

Blocjerk Token is updated version of $BJ as an upgradeable contract, forked version of $DHB (v2, implementation v4).

## Deployment

Execute the following command to deploy $BJ on the network
```bash
npm run deploy [network name]
```

i.e. if you want to deploy on mainnet,
```bash
npm run deploy mainnet
```

## Upgrade contract

Make sure you have already updated contract with new version.
i.e. BlocjerkTokenV4 was updated on top of BlocjerkTokenV3.

1. Deploy implementation contract

```bash
npm run impl [network name]
```

2. Open ProxyAdmin contract on etherscan

Open etherscan.io and go to the address of ProxyAdmin contract, you can find the address in `.openzeppelin/[network].json`.

```json
  "admin": {
    "address": "0xE473C3e0B277255Baf321A75fcf6Ce2C279cD278",
    "txHash": "0x0c5672927fa1bf49be48f4830dd4831d83575c4ceb131d29d8deba787a14eb48"
  },
```

`admin.address` is the address to ProxyAdmin contract.

3. Update implementation address with new one

Write the contract by calling `upgrade`
```javascript
upgrade(
  [proxy address], // $BJ contract address
  [new implementation address] // newly deployed BlockjerkTokenV4 contract
)
```

Open $BJ contract on etherscan and confirm that contract was upgraded.
